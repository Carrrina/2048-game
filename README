My implementation of the game 2048 written exclusively in C, from zero, and tested in Linux terminal. I used the ncurses library for the gui.

What is ncurses:
"ncurses (new curses) is a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing "GUI-like" application software that runs under a terminal emulator." - Wikipedia

!!! It is recommended for the terminal window to have the dimensions at least 80x27 for a proper visualization.

Start menu navigation is done using up/ down arrows.
Gameplay features:
- displays current game board, score, date
- use arrows to move, 'N' for a new game, 'Q' for quite
- after 15s of inactivity the move which clears the boards the most is done automaticaly
- 'U' for undo, can be pressed only once in a row

App features:
- keeps track of different users, their usernames and games history (score and the time it was played)
- highscores menu
- possibility to switch user at any time
- possibility to resume the game started at the previous session provided that it wasn't finished
